The AFGCNv2 Solver is based on Python3. There are two major dependencies that must be installed prior to running the solver: pytorch, the deep learning engine used, and dgl, the graph library used.  

The solver is submitted to the approximate track and supports all the decision problems in that track (DC-PR, DS-PR, DC-ST, DS-ST, DC-CO, DS-CO, DC-SST, DS-SST, DC-STG, DS-STG, DS-ID).

To run the solver please follow the following steps:

Install python3 if not installed. If the pip package manager is not installed, please install that as well.

Then to install the pre-requiste python libraries, please run the following commands:
pip install  dgl -f https://data.dgl.ai/wheels/repo.html
pip install  dglgo -f https://data.dgl.ai/wheels-test/repo.html
pip install torch
pip install scikit-learn

Once the pre-requisites have been put in place the solver can be called in the following manner, conforming to the solver requirements set out in the ICCMA 2023 call for solvers:

./solver.sh -p <problem> -f <file> -a <argument>

Example:

./solver.sh -p DS-ST -f myFile.tgf -a 2
